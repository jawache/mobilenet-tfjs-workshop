# MobileNet Tensorflow Workshop (ng-conf 2019)
Learn to build an image classifier with JavaScript and Tensorflow.js!

## Features
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library to easily prototype front ends.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript with optional static typing.
- [Tesorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): Develop and train ML models in JavaScript on the browser or on Node.js.
- [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet): Small model used for image classification.

## Goal
- Build a simple image classifier from a pre-trained [Tensorflow model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet).

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/jawache/mobilenet-tfjs-workshop.git
